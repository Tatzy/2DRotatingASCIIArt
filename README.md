# 2DRotatingASCIIArt
Small program that simulates rotating objects in ASCII format on the command line

### How it works
When starting the program, you'll be requested to input some type of String that will be used as the ASCII object for the rotation.    
When no input is given the represented object will be a square. You can also input files via the command line, as an example:    
"java RotatingObject < Thing.txt"    
Formatting the ASCII input string properly, is still a work in progress, so there may still be some issues with that.
