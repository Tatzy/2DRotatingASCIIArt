# 2DRotatingASCIIArt
Small program that simulates rotating objects in ASCII format on the command line

### How it works
When starting the program, you'll be requested to input a file name which content will be used as the ASCII object for the rotation.    
When no input is given the represented object will be a square. To use it type "java RotatingObject" into the command line.
